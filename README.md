# SwiftUI_To_MAUI
How to use SwiftUI components as an iOS implementation for MAUI controls.

### How to build
In MacOS terminal

Go to SwiftUI_To_MAUI/Scripts directory then run build.sh script

```zsh
<Scripts directory> ./build.sh
```

The script builds step by step:
 - SwiftUI framework
 - SwiftUI to MAUI binding library
 - MAUI controls library
 
 So, now you can play with MAUI_App for testing, or create your own MAUI app with reference to MAUI_Library.dll and SwiftUI_MAUI_Bindings.dll.
